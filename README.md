# LanCrypt

LAN chat program that uses Hexacrypt encryption algorithm

<br>

## How to Use

When LanCrypt is first run, it pulls up a dialog box of all computers that it can connect to. To chat, simply double click one one of the computer names. Doing so will pull up a chat box. For this to be successful, the remote computer also needs to be running LanCrypt.

In the chat box window, type the message into the textbox at the bottom, then press or click "Send." The sent message will appear on the screen above and in the remote computer's screen. The top of the window has a small label that spins when the remote computer is typing a response message. Sounds can be enabled or disabled by the mute checkbox. If the remote computer hasn't responded in a while, click "Page" to play a short beep on the remote computer. The flash checkbox will cause the chat box window to flash when a new message is recieved.

Hexacrypt encryption can be enabled or disabled with the checkbox in the bottom left corner. If disabled, messages will be sent in plaintext. If enabled, messages will be encrypted using the key specified by the "Key" box. For the transmission to be successful, both computers need to have matching keys. Otherwise, the message decryption will not work display an error in the chat window.
